# Library Management

## Problem Statement

You are asked to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) to simulate the interaction of users with a small library system. The system allows users to borrow and return books, view their borrowed books, and manage their account.

The submission must include an executable `start.sh` file located at the root. When executed, this file should start the application and provide a CLI as demonstrated below. The `start.sh` is executed in an environment fully configured for Java (with the `java` executable in the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to the `JDK`), Node.js (with the `npm` and `node` executables in the `PATH`), and Dart (with the Dart SDK available and its executables in the `PATH`). All SDKs are set to their latest versions. The environment also has internet access, allowing package management tools to download additional dependencies as needed (e.g., `./gradlew build`, `./mvnw package`, `npm install`, `dart pub get`).

Each time `start.sh` is executed, it must create a new environment without reusing any data from previous runs. For instance, if `start.sh` is executed, and new users are created via the CLI, then the process is stopped and `start.sh` is executed again, the application should start fresh with no users registered.

## Commands

* `login [name]` - Logs in as this user and creates the user if they do not already exist
* `add [book_name]` - Adds a new book to the library (can only be done by the user `admin`)
* `list` - Displays the list of books in the library
* `borrow [book_name]` - Borrows a book for the logged-in user. The book is marked as borrowed and will not appear in the library's available list
* `return [book_name]` - Returns a borrowed book to the library. The book becomes available again
* `waitlist [book_name]` - Adds current user to the wait list of the book which is currently borrowed
* `status` - Displays a list of books currently borrowed by the logged-in user and his wait lists (if any)
* `logout` - Logs out of the current user
